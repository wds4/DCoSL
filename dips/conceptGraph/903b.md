relationshipTypes
------------------------------

## Background

[Relationships](../../glossary/relationship.md) were introduced in DIP-???. Just as words were organized in DIP-??? into categories called word types, in this DIP, relationships will be organized into categories called relationship types. Unlike words, which are generally belong to multiple word types, any given relationship generally makes use of only a single relationship type.

[DIP-900](900.md), a new `wordType` will be introduced: `relationshipType`.

## Declaration

Following the convention of [DIP-900](900.md), a new `wordType` will be declared: `relationshipType`

```json
{
  "wordData": {
    "wordTypes": ["wordType"],
  },
  "wordTypeData": {
    "slug": "relationshipType",
    "name: "relationship type",
  },
  ...
}
```

## Example:

```json
{
  "wordData": {
