Bounties
=====

This is a list of bounties related to DCoSL and Pretty Good Apps. They will be submitted to [nostr bounties](https://nostrbounties.com).

# [Curated Lists](./curatedLists)

Refactor Curated Lists (which is currently functional as an app in the Pretty Good Apps desktop client) as a website with stellar UX. Broken down into phases:

## Phase 1 (Curated Lists explorer, very basid) bounty: 10,000,000 sats, or make me an offer

## Phases 2-5 bounties: to be determined

Basically, this thing is already built and working. All you have to do is copy it and give it a great UX.

# [Curated Graphs](./curatedGraphs)

A prototype is under contstruction in Pretty Good Apps, under the name: Curated Channels. Once Curated Lists bounties are complete, bounties will be offered to refactor Curated Graphs as a web app. Other proposals will also be entertained.
