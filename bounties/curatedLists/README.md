Refactor Curated Lists as a website.

## Background

Curated Lists, the app in Pretty Good Apps, is the first implementation of DCoSL procotol and arguably the first ever implementation of decentralized knowledge. 

In its current form, Curated Lists is functional but needs better UX to attract users. This series of bounties is to refactor the existing functionality of Curated Lists as a website.

## Phase 1: read-only

The following phases may be restructured following the succussful completion of phase 1, and their bounties are to be determined.

## Phase 2: add Control Panel for the grapevine

## Phase 3: User sign-in, make new lists, add list items, endorse/reject items, endorse/reject curators

## Phase 4: API
