Various examples (some hypothetical, some implemented) are discussed from the standpoint of the developer considering whether and how to use DCoSL to this particular problem.

Issues to be considered and decisions to be made for any given application:
<li>destination: the list of lists</li>
<li>the first list to be curated and the subsequent order of lists for rollout</li>
<li>loose consensus</li>
<li>DIP-1 and alternate methods of curation</li>

Also consider how to recognize what lists do not need to be curated, or at least should be low on the priority list.
