knowledge representation
=====

Knowledge representation refers to the technical problem of encoding knowledge into a symbolic language that is useful for the task at hand. In the [threaded tapestry model](threadedTapestry.md) of knowledge representation, information is broken into chunks which are represented as nodes in a graph, with edges in the graph representing relationships between the nodes. Any contiguous series of edges is called a [thread](thread.md). Although the number of distinct types of nodes, edges, and threads is unlimited, we will discover that a small handful of specialized node, relationship, and thread types is sufficient to flesh out the full model.
