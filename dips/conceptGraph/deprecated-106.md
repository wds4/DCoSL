DIP-106
======

graph databases
-------------------

## General principle

[Graph databases](../../glossary/graphDatabase.md) are particularly well suited for DCoSL, particularly in later stages of concept graph development. This DIP describes various conventions that may be useful to incorporate graph databases into DCoSL. We will make use of the open source graph database, [neo4j](https://github.com/neo4j/neo4j), and its graph query language, [cypher](https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-manual/current/introduction/) in some of the examples that follow. Note that 'DIP-104-equivalents' could be devised that use different conventions (if you prefer alternatives to , e.g., JSON or neo4j).
