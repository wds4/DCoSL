micro rule
=====

A single [pattern](pattern.md) coupled with a single [action](action.md), in which the pattern is understood to trigger the action wherever it is discovered, is called a micro rule. It may be transcribed as a set with two elements: 


```json
["pattern_i", "action_j"],
```

A set of rules is called a [ruleset](ruleset.md).
