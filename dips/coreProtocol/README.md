# DIPs 00-99: Core Principles

DCoSL is the first step towards implementation of the threaded tapestry model of knowledge representation and knowledge curation for decentralized, distributed systems. This set of DIPs establishes the core principles of this model.

Note: numbering of DIPs is subject to change.

## [DIP-00](00.md) the use of graphs to represent data

Data is represented as graphs: collections of nodes and edges

## [DIP-01](01.md) global scores vs personal scores

Data curation using the [Principle of Relativity for the Web of Trust](https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot1-sf/blob/master/Principle-of-Relativity-for-WoT.md). There is no one list to rule them all.

## [DIP-02](02.md) explicit statements vs scraped data

Rely on explicit statements rather than inferences from scraped data.

## [DIP-03](03.md) data identifiers

This is how we avoid domain squatting

## [DIP-04](04.md) Everything is a collection of simple lists.

Achieve curation of a graph via curation of a few simple lists.

## [DIP-infinity](infinity.md) All DIPs are crowdsourced using the DCoSL method.

## Under construction

## DIP-05 Weighted averages

Averages are weighted averages.

## DIP-??: Trust

means different things to different people. in dcosl, the definition of the wors trust is ultimately determined by how trust scores are used. In many cases this will not coincide with how others use the word; therefore, wherever possible, we will try to use more deacriptive terminology, eg instead of Alice trusts Bob" we will say "Alice endorses Bob as worthy of influence over anyone's content feed in context X."

## DIP-??: Transitivity

Trust is transitive.

## DIP-??: Loose Consensus 

Loose consensus as one of the goals

## DIP-?? Context-based influence

Influence is the quantity to focus on. Introduction to the Grapevine-related core principles. Might add either before or after DIP-04. 

Probably going to remove any reference to the word "trust" anywhere in this repo. May or may not delve into why. But basically, the word means too many things to too many people. True to a lesser extent to several other words and phrases. e.g. "influence score" screams "black mirror dystopia" to some. Whatever we call the scores, how they are used is what defines what they mean. Not what we call them.

Grapevine-related core principles:
- 05 averages are weighted averages
- 06 confidence
- 07 influence
- 08 context
- 09 definition of trust
- 10 transitivity 
- 11 trees 
- 12 default scores

Maybe categorize "core protocol" DIPs as more general principles, less protocol per se:
- networks and universally unique identifiers (move from 100b?)
- perhaps the basic idea of a "word" should be moved here? (currently DIP-100)
