graph
======

A graph is a collection of nodes and edges. Typically in DCoSL protocol, nodes are chunks of data. In theory nodes can be any type of data, but in practice nodes are typically JSON formatted. Edges represent relationships between nodes. Various relationship types are defined and implemented using several DIPs.
