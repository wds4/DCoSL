DIP-121
======

item directories
------------------------------

Following the convention of [DIP-102](102.md), a new `wordType` will be introduced: `item directories`.

## Background

An item directory is a type of graph. For every concept, there will be a single item directory with nodes for that concept's superset, all relevant sets, and all instances (or 'items') of that concept. In addition, there will be relationships using the relationship types: isASubsetOF and isASPecificInstanceOf.

## Declaration

See [here](declarations/itemDirectory.md).

## Example:

Basic example showing basic word structure only:

```json
{
  "wordData": {
    "wordTypes": ["graph","itemDirectory"],
    ...
  },
  "graphData": {
    ...
  },
  "itemDirectoryData": {
    ...
  },
  ...
}
```

For more detailed examples, see [here](examples/itemDirectories).
