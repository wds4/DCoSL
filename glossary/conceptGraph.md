concept graph
======

A concept graph is a graphical representation of data (i.e. in the form of a [graph](graph.md)) which obeys some version of the [class criteria](classCriteria.md). In addition, every word contained within a concept graph must contain the nonempty string: `wordData.slug`, with no two words in the concept graph having the same slug. The slug therefore serves the criteria of a locally unique identifier according to DIP (?).
