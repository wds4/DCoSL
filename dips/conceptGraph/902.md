DIP-902

List
------------------------------

Following the convention of [DIP-900](900.md), a new `wordType` will be introduced: `list`.

A list is one way of creating a new [word type](../../glossary/wordType.md).

By convention, `listData` will contain three string fields: `name.singular`, `name.plural`, and `description`. Effectively, `name.plural` will be the name of the list (e.g. a list of widgets), and `name.singular` will be the word type for any item on the list. For any given list with `name.singular` = `foo`, any given item on that list will be expected to be of word type: `foo` and to contain `fooData` as a top-level property.

In a later DIP, the word type: `concept` will be introduced, which is a `list` with additional structure.

Example #1 a list of `widgets`:

```json
{
  "wordData": {
    "wordTypes": ["list"],
  },
  "listData": {
    "name": {
      "singular": "widget",
      "plural": "widgets",
    },
    "description": "lorem ipsum"
  },
  ...
}
```

The above word creates `widget` as a new `word type`, which is employed in the example below of an item on the list of `widgets`:

```json
{
  "wordData": {
    "wordTypes": ["widget"]
  },
  "widgetData": {
    ...
  }
  ...
}
```

Example #2 a list of `nostr relays`:

```json
{
  "wordData": {
    "wordTypes": ["list"],
  },
  "listData": {
    "name": {
      "singular": "nostr relay",
      "plural": "nostr relays",
    },
    "description": "lorem ipsum",
  }
}
```

As is the case for example #1, the above list implies a new `wordType` to represent nostr relays. Note that the convention is that `wordType` is in camelCase. So in this case, te new wordType is `nostrRelay`, as per the item below, which is an example of an item on the list of `nostr relays`:

```json
{
  "wordData": {
    "wordTypes": ["nostrRelay"],
  },
  "nostrRelayData": {
    "name": "wss://relay.damus.io",
    "description": "lorem ipsum",
  }
}
```

Two methods can be used to avoid any confusion regarding the precise form of the word type created by the new list. The first method is to include the `slug` field in parallel to the `name` field in the list declaration, in which case the implied word type is `listData.slug.singular`, as in the example below:

```json
{
  "wordData": {
    "wordTypes": ["list"],
  },
  "listData": {
    "name": {
      "singular": "nostr relay",
      "plural": "nostr relays",
    },
    "slug": {
      "singular": "nostrRelay",
      "plural": "nostrRelays",
    },
    "description": "lorem ipsum",
  }
}
```

The second method is to declare the new wordType explicitly rather than to create it by implication:

```json
{
  "wordData": {
    "wordTypes": ["wordType"],
  },
  "wordTypeData": {
    "slug": "nostrRelay",
    "name": "nostr relay",
  }
}
```
