Title: Nostr Curated List Instance: Generic Rating


## applicaitons

### used by the Curated Lists app:

- rate an item on a list; 100 = endorse, 0 = reject 

- parent list goes in context 

- item being rated is the ratee


## This template is also used in the Curated Channels app, although I probably ought to make a new template for that purpose
