loose consensus
======

If the contents of a list are not particularly polarizing or controversial (and most of them aren't), then there is a good chance that Alice's WoT and Bob's WoT will come up with the same, or at least very similar, lists. This is known as <i>loose consensus</i>. Much of the power of DCoSL comes from its ability to generate loose consensus.

Alice's WoT and Bob's WoT, though they are not identical, are very likely to have significant overlap. For any given list, although there is no guarantee, there is a good chance that Alice and Bob will end up using the exact same (or at least almost the same) list! This is a vitally important attribute, one that I call loose consensus. You'll want to think deeply about loose consensus before incorporating decentralized list curation to your app.

In some cases, a particularly controversial or politicized list may generate loose consensus that segregates by community.

The term [crowdsource](crowdsource.md) will be used to refer to curation of one or of a collection of simple lists using DCoSL protocol where a high degree of loose consensus is expected, at least within a given community. Schemas, verifiable credentials, etc can be said to be 'crowdsourced' via the DCoSL protocol, in each case through curation of a small handful of simple lists. One of the major challenges to the developer will be to write code that doesn't break when Alice and Bob maintain lists that do not match. Crowdsourcing one or a small handful of lists at a time should mitigate this difficulty
