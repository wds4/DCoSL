App design
====

The purpose of this bounty is to produce a design for an app called "Nostr Channels."

Think of this as the Product Requirements Document

The app is something that I call Nostr Channels, and it would make use under the hood of the protocol for decentralized curation of data that I have been working on for quite some time now. I envision it as a fork of one of the existing nostr clients. The idea is that you open up your client, select a "channel," and see a feed that is enriched for the topic(s) that are selected to correspond to that channel (minus any topics that you want blocked from that channel, e.g. NSFW notes). Your web of trust would curate the list of topics, the organization of topics into a hierarchy, and the association of any given topic with pubkeys and individual notes. You would have the option (if you so desire) to create new topics, to edit their hierarchical organization, to select which users you "trust" to curate specific topics, and to associate pubkeys and note IDs with specific topics. But even before you've had a chance to do any of those things, channel selection would be fully functional. In the beginning the number of available topics and channels would be few, but it would get progressively better and more refined as more and more users participate.
