DIP-1105
=====

This DIP describes use of [NIP-32](https://github.com/staab/nips/blob/nip-32-labeling/32.md) to broadcast a rating. This can be thought of as an alternative to [DIP-1104](https://github.com/wds4/DCoSL/blob/main/dips/networking/nostr/1104.md).


```json
{
  "kind": 1985,
  "tags": [
    ["L", "com.dcosl.ontology"],
    ["l", <concept graph path>, "com.dcosl.ontology",<json rating data>],
    <ratee>,
  ],
  "content": "",
  ...
}
```

`concept graph path` examples: `rating/curator`

Per NIP-32 recommendations, `<JSON rating data>` would be a serialized version of an object with the following suggested keys:

```json
{
  "quality": <a number between 0 and 1>,
  "confidence": <a number between 0 and 1>,
  "context": <any string>
}
```

Alternate: publish the rating as a word, and replace `<json rating data>` with the event id of the word. However, this gets away from the whole point of making it fit into the standard NIP-32 format.

### Example

Compare to [this example](https://github.com/wds4/DCoSL/blob/main/dips/grapevine/ratingsSkeletons/nostrCuratedListsCuratorEndorsement.md) from Curated Lists.

Suppose Alice (`pubkey_Alice`) wants to endorse Bob (`pubkey_Bob`) as a curator of the list of Nostr Devs (`list_event_id`)

QUESTION: how to make a publicly-curated List of Nostr Devs?????

```json
{
  "kind": 1985,
  "tags": [
    ["L", "com.dcosl.ontology"],
    ["l", "rating/curator/<list_event_id>", "com.dcosl.ontology",<json rating data>],
    ["p", <pubkey_Bob>, <relay_url>],
  ],
  "pubkey": <pubkey_Alice>,
  "content": "",
  ...
}
```

Where JSON rating data is the serialized version of:

```json
{
  "quality": 1,
  "confidence": 0.8,
  "context": <any string>
}
```
