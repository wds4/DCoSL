complex list
======

A [simple list](simpleList.md) with at least one of the following additional features as part of the list specification.

Additional features include: 
- properties of lists and list items can be customized by hand by the user, +/- the option of crowdsourcing
- partitioning of list items into subsets can be managed by the user either directly or through crowdsourcing

The ability to partition into subsets could be subsumed into the definition / specification of the list. Alternatively, partitioning into subsets could be managed independently of the list definition or specification.
