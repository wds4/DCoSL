DIP-infinity
======

All DIPs are crowdsourced using the DCoSL method.
------------------------------

## General principle

The DCoSL protocol itself can be expressed as a bunch of lists, and those lists can be managed via DCoSL. When the entire protocol is managed in this decentralized fashion, this is called `DIP-infinity`, or `circular DCoSL` (because DCoSL is being used to define DCoSL).
