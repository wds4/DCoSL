DIP-903
======

relationship, relationshipTypes
------------------------------

## Background: 

In DCoSL, data will frequently be represented as a [graph](../../glossary/graph.md), with [nodes](../../glossary/node.md) and [edges](../../glossary/relationship.md). DIP-900 (?) provides conventions for nodes that are JSON data objects. In this DIP, we provide conventions for edges.

## Declaration

Following the convention of [DIP-900](900.md), a new `wordType` will be declared: `relationship`

```json
{
  "wordData": {
    "wordTypes": ["wordType"],
  },
  "wordTypeData": {
    "slug": "relationship"
  },
  ...
}
```

## Example:

```json
{
  "wordData": {
    "wordTypes": ["relationship"],
  },
  "relationshipData": {
  },
  ...
}
```
