Default properties for newly declared word types
=====

For each word type, by convention, properties `slug`, `name`, `title`, and `description` will be made available by default but will not necessarily be required. Note that in the first example above, `name` and `title` are present under `widgetData` but are absent from `wordData`.

Frequently, the slugs will have the following relationship, as in the example:

```json
```
