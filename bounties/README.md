Bounties
=====

This is a list of bounties related to DCoSL and Pretty Good Apps. They will be submitted to [nostr bounties](https://nostrbounties.com).

# [Curated Lists](./curatedLists)

Refactor Curated Lists, which is already built and currently functional as an app in the Pretty Good Apps desktop client, as a website with a stellar UX.

# [Curated Graphs](./curatedGraphs)

A prototype for Curated Graphs is under construction in Pretty Good Apps, currently under the name: Curated Channels. The basic idea is that a graph is composed of two lists: one list for nodes, one for edges. The basic tools for list curation can therefore be leveraged for curation of graphs.

Once Curated Lists bounties are complete, bounties will be offered to refactor Curated Graphs as a web app.
