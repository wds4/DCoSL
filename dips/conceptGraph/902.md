DIP-902
======

List
------------------------------

Following the convention of [DIP-900](900.md), a new `wordType` will be introduced: `list`.

A list is one way of creating a new [word type](../glossary/wordType.md).

By convention, `listData` will contain three string fields: `name.singular`, `name.plural`, and `description`. Effectively, `name.plural` will be the name of the list (e.g. a list of widgets), and `name.singular` will be the word type for any item on the list. For any given list with `name.singular` = `foo`, any given item on that list will be expected to be of word type: `foo` and to contain `fooData` as a top-level property.

In a later DIP, the word type: `concept` will be introduced, which is a `list` with additional structure.

Example:

```json
{
  "wordData": {
    "wordTypes": ["list"],
  },
  "listData": {
    "name": {
      "singular": "widget",
      "plural": "widgets",
    },
    "description": "lorem ipsum"
  },
  ...
}
```

Example of an item on this list:

```json
{
  "widgetData": {
    ...
  }
  ...
}
```
