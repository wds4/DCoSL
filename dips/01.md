# DIP-1: The grapevine: explicit, intentional attestations rather than scraped data

DIP-1 is based on the attitude that curation via EA is more trustworthy than SD, and that the superiority of EA will grow as the DCoSL ecosystem grows and matures. Of course, a combination of these two methods may be utilized. This dip details a method to use EA by itself.

In DCoSL, the term: `grapevine` is used informally in place of `web of trust` to refer to a web of trust that is built out of intentional attestations rather than scraped data. In addition, as many note, the word `trust` is frequently misleeading and inaccurate for the purpose at hand.

According to this dip, list curation is based upon explicit attestations (EA) rather than scraped data (SD) obtained using other methods. These are two opposing methods for list curation, described and discussed (here). An example of an explicit attestation would be the signed statement: Alice endorses [array of pubkeys ] as sources of trustworthy content. An example of scraped data would be a WoT built upon a following list. 

Two categories of attestations are utilized.
<li>Alice endorses Bob as a trusworthy curator of this list.</li>
<li>Alice endorses this item as belonging / not belonging to this list.</li>

Each attestation is binary.
