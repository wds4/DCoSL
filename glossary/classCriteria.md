class criteria
======

Class criteria refers to the following constraints:
- Every node in the graph is the instance of at least one [concept](concept.md).
- Every [instance](specificInstance.md) obeys the data content and data formatting rules transmitted through the [class node](classNode.md).

A [concept graph](conceptGraph.md) is defined by adherence to these constraints.
