DIP-120
======

graph types
------------------------------

Following the convention of [DIP-102](102.md), a new `wordType` will be introduced: `graph type`.

## Background

[Graphs](../../glossary/graph.md) were introduced in [DIP-105](105.md). Just as words ([DIP-100](100.md)) were placed into categories called word types ([DIP-102](102.md)), in this DIP, graphs will be organized into categories called graph types.

## Declaration

```json
{
  "wordData": {
    "wordTypes": ["wordType"],
  },
  "wordTypeData": {
    "slug": "graphType",
    "name": "graph type",
  },
  ...
}
```

## Properties

## Examples:
