## Synopsis

In DCoSL, trust is transitive. If Alice trusts Bob and Bob trust Charlie, then Charlie will have influence over Alice's curated knowledge, even if she has no direct knowledge ov Charlie. 

## reach

How far does transitivity extend? How many hops away should users be trusted? The answer to this question is termed `reach`. Multiple methods exist to determine the `reach`. The simplest would be to set a cutoff, e.g. web of trust extends N hops away. A more sophisticated method is to use an `attenuation factor` which is a scalar between 0 and 1, which decays the influence by a certain amount with each hop.
