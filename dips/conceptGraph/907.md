DIP-907
======

concept
------------------------------


## Background



## Definition

Given a node N of type: wordType, a `concept` is defined as the collection of all nodes and all edges formed by the union of all [class threads](../../glossary/classThread.md) that `emanate` from word N. 

(Whether or not the property tree that feeds into the jsonSchema at the start of a class thread is included in the definition of a concept is yet to be determined.)

A word type, `concept`, will be introduced, the purpose of which is to keep a structured record of the core nodes for any concept.

Following the convention of [DIP-900](900.md), a new `wordType` will be declared: `concept`

```json
{
  "wordData": {
    "wordTypes": ["wordType"],
  },
  "wordTypeData": {
    "slug": "concept"
  },
  ...
}
```
## Properties

Under `conceptData`, the property: `node` will be introduced, which contains a record of the structural nodes that make up any given concept. Additional properties will be added in later DIPs.

## Example

```json
{
  "wordData": {
    "wordTypes": ["concept"],
  },
  "conceptData": {
    "nodes": {
      "wordType": {
        "slug": "wordTypeFor_widget",
      },
      "jsonSchema": {
        "slug": "jsonSchemaFor_widget",
      },
      "superset": {
        "slug": "supersetFor_widget",
      },
      "concept": {
        "slug": "conceptFor_widget",
      },
    }
  },
  ...
}
```
