conceptualization
======

Conceptualization is the process of organizing data into the format of a [concept graph](conceptGraph.md).

The primary motivation for data conceptualization is to prepare it for the DCoSL protocol. It does so by breaking data down into simple lists and doing so in a manner that is resistant to things breaking when additions or subtractions are made to a list. (need a word for this property? robust, resilience ...)
