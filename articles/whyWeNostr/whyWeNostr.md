Why We Nostr: Nostr, Decentralized Reputation and Web of Trust
=====

Outline of proposed presentation

Show note from Guy Swann 7 Oct 23: "Have you ever stopped to really think about how astronomical the power to control information is?"

Three categories of power:
- physical violence
- control over flow of value
- control over flow of information

Bitcoin addresses flow of value. We are still working on flow of information!

## What exactly are we trying to achieve?

We live on a planet with billions of people, free (one would hope) to associate and interact as they wish. What does that mean? It means: the spontaneous, dynamic organization of individuals into networks (a.k.a. communities, tribes) both large and small, sometimes overlapping, each one of which is capable of highly sophisticated intra-network communication and coordinated action. As cypherpunks we strive to build the tools to serve those needs. Tools that can be customized to the specific, changing, frequently unforseen (by devs) needs of each network. But there's a catch: we strive to build tools that do not require any one person, developer, team, or entity to manage those tools or to be in charge of the network. Have we succeeded? We're making progress, but we're not there yet.

## Why is nostr ideally suited

WE NEED NEW IDEAS. PERMISSIONLESS INNOVATION. TINKERING AROUND THE EDGES.

Nostr's structure using NIPs makes it much easier for new devs to get started than a "cathedral", like bluesky, which requires tremendous technical buy-in before a new developer can even pass go.

## Proposed Roadmap: past, present, and future

âœ… decentralized identity and messaging: PGP, 1991, Phil Zimmermann<br/>
âœ… decentralized platforms: nostr<br/>
âœ… decentralized GENERATION of lists: NIP-51<br/>
ðŸ”² decentralized CURATION of lists<br/>
ðŸ”² ... of graphs<br/>
ðŸ”² ... of ontologies<br/>
ðŸ”² ... of standards<br/>
ðŸ”² ... of repositories<br/>

From GENERATION to CURATION is the barrier that we have not yet crossed. Once we do, all of the dominoes will fall!

Permissionless innovation ftw!
