DIPs 1000-1099

List of networks
- [DIP-1000](1000.md): nostr
- [DIP-1001](1001.md): ipfs

A suggested method of organization would be:
- one DIP to specifiy how to publish data from the network
- one DIP to specify how to retrieve data from the network
- one DIP to describe the structure of `wordData.metaData.[network-specific slug]`
