DIP-107
======

jsonSchema
------------------------------

Following the convention of [DIP-102](102.md), a new `wordType` will be introduced: `jsonSchema`. The purpose of a JSON Schema node will be to provide formatting data for other words. In a future DIP, a convention for a path rule will be described which specifies which node(s) are expected to validate properly against which JSON Schema node(s).

Note that DCoSL allows alternatives to JSON Schema to be used. (In fact, alternatives to JSON itself can be used, if desired.) In a subsequent DIP, the wordType: `classDefinition` (might use another name?) will be introduced, with `jsonSchema` being simply one possible example of a `classDefinition`.

Convention: specification for the format of the object `jsonSchemaData` is found in [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org).

## Example:

```json
{
  "wordData": {
    "wordTypes": ["jsonSchema"],
  },
  "jsonSchemaData": {
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
      "widgetData": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
          "name": {
            "type": "string"
          },
          "description": {
            "type": "string"
          }
        }
      }
    }
  },
  ...
}
```

The word (below) is an example of a word that validates against the JSON Schema in `jsonSchemaData` (above).

```json
{
  "widgetData": {
    "name": "my widget",
    "description": "lorem ipsum",
  },
  ...
}
```
