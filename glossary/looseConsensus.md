loose consensus
======

Given a list that is curated using the DCoSL protocol, if the list is not particularly polarizing or controversial (and most of them aren't), then there is a good chance that Alice's WoT and Bob's WoT will come up with the same, or at least very similar, lists. This is known as loose consensus.
