DIP-104

Graph Database
------------------------------

## General principle

[Graph databases](../../glossary/graphDatabase.md) are particularly well suited for DCoSL, particularly in later stages of concept graph development. This DIP describes one way to incorporate them. We will make use of the open source graph database, [neo4j](https://github.com/neo4j/neo4j), and its graph query language, [cypher](https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-manual/current/introduction/).

Following [DIP-02](../02.md), Every node and every relationship in the graph database will be associated with a cryptographic identifier. Wherever possible, we will format data files using JSON, so that one node is a single JSON object.
