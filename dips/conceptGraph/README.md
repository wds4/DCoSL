# The Concept Graph

See a list of [important concepts](importantConcepts.md).

## prerequisites

- [DIP-03](../03.md): Representation of a graph using simple lists.

## DIPS 100-199: the Concept Graph

There will be a natural progression from simple lists, to complex lists, to concepts, to the concept graph.

- [DIP-100](100.md): simple list

- [DIP-101](101.md): complex list: a simple list with added structure

- [DIP-102](102.md): concept

- [DIP-103](103.md): concept graph

- [DIP-104](104.md): implementation as a graph database

# NOT YET ADDED:

- [DIP-10*](10*.md): class

analogy to the class in object-oriented programming

threads, class threads, class node, class instance, class thread rule

- [DIP-105](105.md): use of graphs to represent complex lists and other data structures

- [DIP-105](105.md): graphical representation of a concept

- [DIP-106](106.md): graphical representation of a property tree

- [DIP-107](107.md): graphical representation of a context tree

- [DIP-108](108.md): graphical representation of schemas

- [DIP-109](109.md): graphical representation of JSON-LD

- [DIP-110](110.md): graphical representation of data model
