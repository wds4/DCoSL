======

Use cryptographic identifiers for lists and list items.
------------------------------

## General principle

Contrast the hashtag method (the text of the hashtag itself is the identifier) with the cryptographi identifier method. Example: `abc123` rather than `Damus`.

Example identifiers: nostr note event id; IPFS hash; IPNS hash; bitcoin address.

Advantages of the cryptographic identifier method: 

Advantage 1: It allows other fields, like description, to be associated with the list or list item. To a list of `user descriptors`, Alice and Bob may each add the item: `troll`. They can each provide their own definition of what constitutes a troll, and the community can select which definition to use in any given context.

Advantage 2: multi language support, uniting list items from multiple languages.
```
{
  name: {
    english: 'pencil',
    spanish: 'lapiz',
  },
  description: 'a writing instrument that uses graphite',
  cryptographic-identifier: 'abc123',
}
```
Using the hashtag method, `pencil` and `l√°piz` would be completely separate.
