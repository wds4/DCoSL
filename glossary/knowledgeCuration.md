knowledge curation
=====

`Knowledge curation` refers to the technical problem of ranking or choosing among alternatives, often in a context-specific manner and according to some system of values. Knowledge cannot be curated without first being encoded in some manner. Therefore, to solve the problem of knowledge curation, the problem of knowledge representation must also be solved.
