# Declarations

## Background

A `declaration` is a method for generation of a new `word type` (see: DIPs --, ...), which in turn is the nucleus for generation of a new `concept` (per DIP --).

The declaration itself is a `word` of `word type`: `word type`. 

The declaration does not tell you everything there is to know about the new work type. For example: the list of top-level properties of a specific instance of the new word type is not included in the declaration, unless it is part of the description. To find or edit the properties, look for the corresponding `json schema`. Separation of the declaration from properties (and other things) allows for modularity and flexibility of the concept graph system.
