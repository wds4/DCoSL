graph
======

A graph is a collection of [nodes](node.md) and [edges](relationship.md) (a.k.a. `relationships`). Typically in the DCoSL protocol, nodes are chunks of data. In theory nodes can be any type of data; digital, analog, whatever. By DCoSL convention, most nodes are JSON formatted data files referred to as [words](word.md). Edges represent relationships between nodes. Various [relationship types](relationshipType.md) are defined and implemented using several DIPs.
