The Grapevine
=====

STATUS OF THIS DOCUMENT: very rudimentary. However, you can download and play with Curated Lists within [Pretty Good Apps](https://github.com/wds4/pretty-good) to see the grapevine in action (or see example with screenshots [here](https://github.com/wds4/pretty-good/blob/main/appDescriptions/curatedLists/exampleListCuration.md)).

See the list of [important concepts](importantConcepts.md).

`The grapevine` is the term used for a web of trust that follows [DIP-01](../coreProtocol/01.md). (Other qualifications?)

## DIPs 200-299: the Grapevine

For publication of attestations, ratings, etc over nostr, see the networking section on [nostr](https://github.com/wds4/DCoSL/tree/main/dips/networking/nostr)

- [DIP-200](200.md): averages are weighted averages 
- [DIP-201](201.md): general format of a user 'trust' rating

## calculation and usage of USER INFLUENCE

- [DIP-20*](20*.md): Use user influence as the weight when calculating weighted averages

- [DIP-20*](20*.md): influence is product of trust score and certainty

- [DIP-20*](20*.md): inheritance of influence scores down a context tree

- [DIP-20*](20*.md): adjustable default user influence

- [DIP-20*](20*.md): allow users to include confidence rating to a trust rating

- [DIP-20*](20*.md): calculation of certainty from input

- [DIP-20*](20*.md): transitivity 

- [DIP-20*](20*.md): attenuation factor
