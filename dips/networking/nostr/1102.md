=====
retrieval of a word from the nostr network
-----

Words published as per [DIP-1101](1101.md) (formerly 901) (updated for testnet-2) using the `createWord` task, can be retrieved using a filter similar to the following example, which is taken from the [declation for word](../../conceptGraph/declarations/word.md):

```json
{
  "since": 0,
  "kinds": [9902],
  "authors": ["c51a542e4f93afe6f45e5bef002f7a0efcc0a47460a736654c0bee5402c482fa"],
  "#c": ["concept-graph-testnet-902"],
  "#w": ["word"],
}
```

or

```json
{
  "ids": ["4a5517d25ebae34b9794f1b8d4dba0681f7ff7297bacbc29de2c915695c53bfe"],
}
```

more details forthcoming

for now, refer to DIP-1101 for the system of kinds and tags
