# Refactor the desktop app, Curated Lists, as a web app

## Bounty: 10,000,000 sats

## Background

Curated Lists, one of the apps in the [Pretty Good Apps](https://github.com/wds4/pretty-good) desktop nostr client, is a proof of concept implementation of the [DCoSL](https://github.com/wds4/dcosl) procotol, the goal of which is a general framework for the decentralized representation and curation of knowledge.

In its current form, Curated Lists is functional but needs better UX to attract users and gain visibility. A series of bounties is envisioned to refactor the existing functionality of Curated Lists as a website (and maybe eventually to add some additional functionality, such as an API).

This bounty refers to [Phase 1](https://github.com/wds4/DCoSL/blob/main/bounties/curatedLists/phase1.md), basic Curated Lists explorer. Follow the link for additional details.

See the [overview](https://github.com/wds4/DCoSL/tree/main/bounties) of DCoSL and Pretty Good Apps bounties (including a roadmap for future bounties beyond this one).
