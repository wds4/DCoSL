Concept Graph maintenance and upkeep
=====

The purpose of this collection of DIPs is to update a concept graph to enforce rules. For example: if a new word is added as a specific instance of a set (set A), then that set will need to be updated to include the new word on its list of specific instances (in metaData? or elsewhere?). In addition, the new word will need to be added to any other sets of which set A is a subset.
