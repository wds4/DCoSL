Grapevine Curation Protocols
=====

A series of Grapevine-enabled applications or platforms will be designed, each one of which maps to a single Grapevine Curation Protocol (GCP).

Each app or platform will come with a brief description of the app.

A Grapevine Curation Protocol (GPC) consists of three major sections:

- the data model, e.g. a simple list or a simple graph, or a graph with restrictions placed on the allowed node types and edge types
- a list of user actions, e.g. that the user can add instances to a particular list or concept and can make certain types of attestations
- a specification of what tht Grapevine will calculate and how it will calculate it
