# DIPs 00-99: the DCoSL Core Protocol

See also Concept Graph [DIPS 100-199](../conceptGraph) and the Grapevine [DIPS 200-299](../grapevine).

The introductory DIP is [DIP-00](00.md), the requirements of which are already met by some projects (see the [spec](00.md) for examples). The first major step in the adoption of DCoSL is [DIP-01](01.md). An example implementation of DIP-01 can be found in the desktop app, [Pretty Good Apps](https://github.com/wds4/pretty-good), which was a major undertaking due to the fact that it also incorporates a number of other DIPs (need to make list). Currently working on a more simple, straightforward example implementation of DIP-01.

For many DIPs, specific details of implementation will be provided. However, DCoSL is designed to be tolerant of alternative implementations. Any implementation of a DIP that achieves the same purpose but differs only in details will be referred to as a `DIP-xx-substitute`, a `DIP-xx-alternative` or a `DIP-xx-equivalent`. (Provide example of this.) The final DIP, [DIP-infinity](infinity.md) a.k.a. `circular DCoSL`, indicates that all implementation details of the DCoSL protocol are themselves curated by the community using the DCoSL protocol.

- [DIP-00](00.md) Lists are curated independently by each user. There is no universal, preferred or 'correct' list.

- [DIP-01](01.md) Rely on explicit attestations rather than scraped data.

- [DIP-02](02.md) Use cryptographic identifiers for lists and list items.

- [DIP-03](03.md) Representation of a graph using simple lists.

- [DIP-infinity](infinity.md) All DIPs are crowdsourced using the DCoSL method.
