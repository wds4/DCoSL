DIP-112

concept graph
------------------------------

## Background

Following the convention of [DIP-102](102.md), a new `wordType` will be introduced: `concept graph`.

## Definition

A `concept graph` is a [graph](../../glossary/graph.md) with [words](../../glossary/word.md) as nodes that satisfies the following core criteria:
- every word is the [class instance](../../glossary/classInstance.md) of at least one [class thread](../../glossary/classThread.md)
- There are no violations of the class thread rule. That is to say, that for every class thread, the class instance follows the format as specified in the [class node](../../glossary/classNode.md).

Supplementary criteria:
- Every word in the concept graph has a nonempty string: `wordData.slug`, which satisfies the criteria to be a slug (camelCase -- maybe need a DIP for slug?). Within the concept graph, there are no two words with identical slugs. Thus, the word's slug serves as a locally unique (local to the concept graph) human readable identifier.

## Declaration

```json
{
  "wordData": {
    "wordTypes": ["wordType"],
  },
  "wordTypeData": {
    "slug": "conceptGraph"
  },
  ...
}
```

## Properties

Generally, a concept graph is specified as a union of one or more graphs which are imported using the property: `graphs`, which is an array, and/or as the union of one or more concepts which are imported using the property: `concepts`, which is an array. The elements of these arrays are objects with pointers to nodes.

## Example:

```json
{
  "wordData": {
    "wordTypes": ["conceptGraph"],
  },
  "conceptGraphData": {
    "concepts": [],
    "graphs": []
  },
  ...
}
```
