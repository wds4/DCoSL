DIP-900
=====
`wordData.metaData.nostr`
-----

This DIP specifies the `wordData.metaData.nostr` property which is used for referring to and locating words.

## stewardPubkey

Universal unique IDs in metaData require a steward with the authority of linking the immutable name to the mutable name when there are uptates. In nostr, this is the stewardPubkey, analogous to the peerID in ipfs.

The convention is that words are published using a specifically designated nostr pubkey, called a steward pubkey. Each steward is expected to maintain unique wordData.slug. For example: if you want to provide multiple competing definitions for troll, then either you can do it using the same nostr account but distinct slugs (troll_abc123 vs troll_bcd234) or, if you want to keep the slug troll without the excess baggage of the suffix, you need to do it with 

In other words, one steward pubkey is considered to correspond to one concept graph, including the requirement that every slug within any individual concept graph is unique. Multiple concept graphs require multiple steward pubkeys.

## metaData structure

Will be structured according to the following example:

```json
{
  "wordData": {
    ...
    "metaData": {
      "nostr": {
        "stewardPubkey": "276b1735fae23a6d32489a380467b7799764536170e92451029ded1c0a919084"
        "uniqueIDs": {
          "slug": "wordType_word"
        }
      }
    }
  },
  ...
}
```
