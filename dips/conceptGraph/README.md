# The Concept Graph

In DCoSL, data is represented as a [graph](../../glossary/graph.md), with [nodes](../../glossary/node.md) and [edges](../../glossary/relationship.md). A concept graph is a graph with additional structure, as described though this series of DIPs.

A simple list will be defined in ([DIP-106](106.md)) as a node with particular characteristics. The idea of a simple list will then mature into the notion of a concept ([DIP-111](111.md)).

See a list of [important concepts](importantConcepts.md).

## prerequisites

- [DIP-03](../03.md): Representation of a graph using simple lists.

## DIPS 100-199: the Concept Graph

There will be a natural progression from simple lists, to complex lists, to concepts, to the concept graph.

- [DIP-100](100.md): words
- [DIP-101](101.md): publication of a word over nostr
- [DIP-102](102.md): word types
- [DIP-103](103.md): relationships
- [DIP-104](104.md): relationship types
- [DIP-105](105.md): graphs
- [DIP-106](106.md): lists
- [DIP-107](107.md): json schemas
- [DIP-108](108.md): sets
- [DIP-109](109.md): supersets
- [DIP-110](110.md): class threads
- [DIP-111](111.md): concepts
- [DIP-112](112.md): concept graphs
- [DIP-113](113.md): properties
- [DIP-114](114.md): graph types
