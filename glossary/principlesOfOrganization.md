Principles of Organization
=====

According to the *tapestry method*, the *principles of organization* of the tapestry are the principles that apply structure to the tapestry. There are two categories: inclusive principles and exclusive principles.

## inclusive principles

The *tapestry method* is predicated on the notion that principles should be as inclusive as possible, because the purpose of language is to communicate with others, and principles will not be useful if other entities do not adopt them. Inclusive principles should be as simple and as powerful as possible and should avoid adoption of any attributes that are arbitrary and / or lack a Schelling point.

The first and second principles of organization are:

- The *class thread principle*. This principle provides a method to group nodes into sets.

- the *class object principle*. (will probably rename this something. ??? the deconstruct-constraints-into-proerties-to-maximize-horizontal-integration set of principles???) This principle is to maximize horizontal integration of the tapestry by breaking down constraints into as many smaller pieces as possible, called *properties*, to organize them into a tree structure, and to identify the set of allowed values of a property with an external concept.

## exclusive principles

The *tribal tapestry method* is predication on the notion that one way to demonstrate allegiance to a tribe is to prove disloyalty to a competing tribe. This is achieved through *virtue signaling*. Virtue signals are designed to antagonize non tribal members by through the promotion, advocacy, or endorsement of tribe-specific *toxic threads*.
