micro ruleset
=====

A `micro ruleset` is a set of [micro rules](rmicroRule.md). It can be transcribed as follows:

```json
[
  ["pattern_i1", "action_j1"],
  ["pattern_i2", "action_j2"]
]
```

Frequently, a ruleset is grouped so that all elements in the ruleset are the same pattern. 


```json
[
  ["pattern_i", "action_j1"],
  ["pattern_i", "action_j2"]
]
```
