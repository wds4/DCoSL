DIP-infinity
======

All DIPs are crowdsourced using the DCoSL method.
------------------------------

## General principle

The DCoSL protocol itself can be expressed as a bunch of lists, and those lists can be managed via DCoSL. When the entire protocol is managed in this decentralized fashion, this is called DIP-infinity, or circular DCoSL (because DCoSL is being used to define DCoSL). Once DIP-infinity is reached, there will be no need to rely upon standards committees or repository maintainers.

Example: the [DIPs](../conceptGraph) that establish the concept graph give rise to a [list of word types](../wordTypes.md) and a [list of relationship types](relationshipTypes.md) which form the core of a concept. Each of these lists can be curated using the DCoSL protocol.
