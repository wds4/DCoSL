# DIPs 00-99: the DCoSL Core Protocol

The only proposal that is absolutely required for DCoSL is DIP-0. Every proposal after that is optional. 

For many DIPs, specific details of implementation will be provided. However, DCoSL is designed to be tolerant of alternative implementations. Any implementation of a DIP that achieves the same purpose but differs only in details will be referred to as a `DIP-xx-substitute`, a `DIP-xx-alternative` or a `DIP-xx-equivalent`. (Provide example of this.) The final DIP, DIP-infinity a.k.a. circular DCoSL, indicates that all implementation details of the DCoSL protocol are themselves curated using the DCoSL protocol.

- [DIP-00](00.md) There is no universal, preferred or 'correct' list.

- [DIP-01](01.md) explicit, intentional attestations are preferred over scraped data

- [DIP-02](02.md) The grapevine: scores as weighted averages

- [DIP-03](03.md) The grapevine: transitivity

- [DIP-04](04.md) The grapevine: default scores

- [DIP-05](05.md) The grapevine: context trees and score inheritance

- [DIP-06](06.md) The grapevine: confidence and certainty

- [DIP-07](07.md) The grapevine: mapping influence to certainty

- [DIP-08](08.md)

- [DIP-09](09.md)

- [DIP-10](10.md)
