hybrid words
------------------------------

A hybrid word is one that is multiple word types.

## class thread simplification

Several nodes within a class thread may be combined. Frequently wordType and jsonSchema word types are combined. See these [examples](https://github.com/wds4/DCoSL/tree/main/dips/conceptGraph/examples/hybrids).

## subsets

Or in cases where one concept, like dog, is a subset of another concept, like animal, as in the following example:

```json
{
  "wordData": {
    "wordTypes": ["animal", "dog"]
  },
  "animalData": {},
  "dogData": {}
}
```

The convention in this case is to order the top-level properties from generic to specific, e.g. to place `animalData` before `dogData`..
