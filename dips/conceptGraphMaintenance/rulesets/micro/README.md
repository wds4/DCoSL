micro rulesets
=====

A micro ruleset consists of:
- a single pattern, which is a local pattern
- one or more actions which are intended to be triggered by the pattern
  
# execution of the fundamental macro ruleset of the concept graph: the class thread criterion 

For the class thread criterion, all patterns are local patterns. Therefore the class thread criterion is a local ruleset.

# execution of the JSON Schea macro ruleset

The JSON Schema macro ruleset is also a local ruleset.
