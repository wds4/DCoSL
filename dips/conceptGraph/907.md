## Background



## Definition

Given a node N of type: wordType, a `concept` is defined as the collection of all nodes and all edges formed by the union of all class nodes that emanate from word N. 

(Whether or not the property tree that feeds into the jsonSchema at the start of a class thread is included in the definition of a concept is yet to be determined.)
