# DIPs 00-99: Core Principles

DCoSL is the first step towards implementation of the threaded tapestry model of knowledge representation and knowledge curation for decentralized, distributed systems. This set of DIPs establishes the core principles of this model.

Note: numbering of DIPs is subject to change.

## [DIP-00](00.md) graphs

Data is represented as graphs: collections of nodes and edges

## [DIP-01](01.md) global scores vs personal scores

Data curation using the [Principle of Relativity for the Web of Trust](https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot1-sf/blob/master/Principle-of-Relativity-for-WoT.md).

## [DIP-02](02.md) explicit statements vs scraped data

Rely on explicit statements rather than inferences from scraped data.

## [DIP-03](03.md) data identifiers

This is how we avoid domain squatting

## [DIP-04](04.md) Everything is a collection of simple lists.

Achieve curation of a graph via curation of a few simple lists.

## [DIP-05](05.md) Weighted averages

Averages are weighted averages.

## [DIP-06](06.md) confidence

confidence

## [DIP-07](07.md) influence

## [DIP-08](08.md) context

## [DIP-09](09.md) trust

means different things to different people. in dcosl, the definition of the wors trust is ultimately determined by how trust scores are used. In many cases this will not coincide with how others use the word; therefore, wherever possible, we will try to use more deacriptive terminology, eg instead of Alice trusts Bob" we will say "Alice endorses Bob as worthy of influence over anyone's content feed in context X."

## [DIP-10](10.md) transitivity

Trust is transitive.

## [DIP-11](11.md) default settings

## [DIP-12](12.md) inheritance

## DIP-13: Loose Consensus 

Loose consensus as one of the goals

## [DIP-infinity](infinity.md) All DIPs are crowdsourced using the DCoSL method.
