Graph Database
------------------------------

## General principle

[Graph databases](../../glossary/graphDatabase.md) are particularly well suited for DCoSL, particularly in later stages of concept graph development. This DIP describes various conventions that may be useful to incorporate graph databases into DCoSL. We will make use of the open source graph database, [neo4j](https://github.com/neo4j/neo4j), and its graph query language, [cypher](https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-manual/current/introduction/) in some of the examples that follow. Note that 'DIP-104-equivalents' could be devised that use different conventions (if you prefer alternatives to , e.g., JSON or neo4j).

## Conventions 

Following [DIP-02](../02.md), Every node and every relationship in the graph database will be associated with one or more cryptographic identifiers, which are (presumably) globally unique. In addition, human-readable identifiers may be used, with one of the concept graph criteria being that all such identifiers must be unique within a concept graph.

The DCoSL convention for nodes: Wherever possible, we will format data files using JSON, with each node representing a single JSON object. Other types of nodes with other formats (images, other data types such as XML or CSV, etc) will be assumed in principle to exist.

Nodes that follow the DCoSL convention will be referred to as a `word`. Each word will have a top-level property: `wordData` with mutable, human-readable unique identifiers. Mutable but non-human-readable unique identifiers will be found under `metaData`. For example:

```
{
  wordData: {
    slug: 'fooBar_63b621',
    name: 'foo bar',
    title: "Foo Bar',
  },
  ...
  metaData: {
    nostrEventID: '7380e72c0e029f55cff42cf4d437ea98c1d5bd9d206345e564d4c4511163b621',
  },
}
```

In the above example, name and title are not required to be unique within the concept graph. However, wordData.slug must be unique. To enfore uniqueness, the convention will be to create the slug from the name, using camel case, with underscore followed by the last 6 characters of whatever non-human-readable mutableidentifier is being used.
