words and wordTypes
------------------------------

## General principle

The basic starting point (DIP-0* ?) is to represent as a graph, with nodes and edges. Graph databases like neo4j could be considered but are not recommended and probably not beneficial until later stages with large concepg graphs.

DIP-900: a word is a node which is JSON and which has the top level property wordData as an objct. (Could show the JSON schema for this.) That's it. 

A `word` is a [node](../glossary/node.md) in a [concept graph](../glossary/conceptGraph.md) which represents a single object in JSON and which follows the conventions in this DIP.

### words

Conventions:
- top-level properties may include `wordData` and `metaData`
- human-readable identifiers such as `slug` will be located under `wordData`
- typically `slug` identifier will be unique within any given [concept graph](../glossary/conceptGraph.md)
- cryptographic identifiers (mutable ones, such as IPNS name) will be located under `metaData`

Example:

```json
{
  "wordData": {
    "slug": "fooBar_e12345",
    "name": "foo bar",
    "title": "Foo Bar",
  },
  ...
  "metaData": {
    "IPNS": "abcde12345",
  },
}
```

In the above example, name and title are not required to be unique within the concept graph. However, `wordData.slug` must be unique. To enfore uniqueness, a common practice will be to create the slug from the name, using camelCase, with underscore followed by the last 6 characters of whatever non-human-readable mutableidentifier is being used.

The publication of a `word` to nostr is described in [DIP-105](105.md).
