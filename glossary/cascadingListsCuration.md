cascading lists curation
=====

Briefly, cascading lists curation is the process of assigning the items of one curated list to be the trusted curators of another curated list. These two lists are said to be "linked" (need a better term for this?). 

Multiple sequential linkages, one after another, is a "cascade" of linked lists.

### Example

Use standard dcosl to curate a list of regular people (non-bots). Call this List 1. Now suppose you wish to curate a list of pubkeys which are official representatives of state-level department of motor vehicle (DMV) tasked with drivers license submission. Normally with dcosl, you would start by endorsing one or more people as curators of this particula list. But if you can't think of anyone, you can "link" it to List 1, which means that anyone on List 1 can now endorse curators of List 2, which means that you don't have to. In practice, only a small number of people on list 1 will probably make such endorsements. The result, hopefully, will be a curated List 2 that contains one cryptographic key for the DMV for each state, 50 in all. The members of List 2, in turn, can be "linked" to List 3, which is a list of US Citizens with valid drivers licences.
