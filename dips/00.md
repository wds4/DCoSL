DIP-00
======

Lists are curated independently by each user. There is no universal, preferred or 'correct' list.
------------------------------

## General principle

Each user is at the center of his or her web of trust, and each user's lists are curated independently. There is no Universal List. Each and every user maintains his or her own list. Alice's list and Bob's list may or may not be the same.

This principle is elaborated more fully here: [Principle of Relativity for the Web of Trust](https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot1-sf/blob/master/Principle-of-Relativity-for-WoT.md)

The particulars of the web of trust and the method of curation are not relevant to this dip.

## Example implementation: [Pretty Good Apps](https://github.com/wds4/pretty-good) (navigate to nostr, settings, relays)

In Pretty Good Apps provides an example of curation of a list of nostr relays that satisfies the requirements of DIP-00 (but not DIP-01). The user's client cycles through each user being followed and adds each relay on that user's active relay list to the list undergoing curation. Data is 'scraped' from each user by looking at nostr notes (type 4 ??? need to check this). These nostr notes are not explicit endorsements intended for other users to consume, but are created for the purpose of managing one's own relays. This curation method therefore satisfies DIP-00 but not DIP-01.
