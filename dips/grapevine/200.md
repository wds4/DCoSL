average scores
-----

average scores are <i>weighted</i> averages

weight depends on a number of factors, but mostly on our assessment of how much credence we give to a user in the context in question

legacy systems already use weighted averages, but in a crude sense only: weights typically can only take values of 1 or 0. in real life, ofc, the amount of weight we place in what Alice says vs what Bob says may or may not be the same.
