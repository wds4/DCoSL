class instance
======

A `class instance` (a.k.a a `specific instance` or simply an `instance`) is the final node of a [class thread](classThread.md). According to the [class thread rule](classThreadRule.md), an instance must follow blueprint instructions transmitted by or specified within the [class node](classNode.md) at the opposite end of the class thread. The instance of a class thread may also be referred to as an instance of the concept that is defined by the corresponding class node. Any node can be, and usually is, a specific instance of more that one concept (and hence, more than one class thread).
