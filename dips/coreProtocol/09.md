## Synopsis

In DCoSL, the word "trust" will generally refer to the willingness to allow the trusted user to curate knowledge for you. It is intended to be highly contextual. Trust can be direct, meaning that Alice has direct knowledge of Bob, or indirect, meaning that it is calculated using DCoSL. We recognize that the word trust may have different interpretations outside the context of DCoSL.

## Overview

Trust means different things to different people. In dcosl, the definition of the word trust is ultimately determined by how trust scores are used. In many cases this will not coincide with how others use the word; therefore, wherever possible, we will try to use more descriptive terminology, eg instead of saying that "Alice trusts Bob on the topic of X" we will instead say "Alice endorses Bob as worthy of influence over her (or anyone's) curated data in the context of X." Of course, this is pretty long winded, so the word trust will still sometimes be used.
