DIP-900
======

words and wordTypes
------------------------------

## General principle

assume graph databases bc they're cool, assume nodes are JSON files bc everyone is using them

### words

Nodes that follow this DIP will be referred to as a `word`. Each word will have a top-level property: `wordData` with mutable, human-readable unique identifiers. Mutable but non-human-readable unique identifiers will be found under `metaData`. 

table of identifiers:

slug, name, title

nostrEventID, IPFS, IPNS

(other identifiers are also OK)

For example:

```json
{
  "wordData": {
    "slug": "fooBar_63b621",
    "name": "foo bar",
    "title": "Foo Bar",
  },
  ...
  "metaData": {
    "nostrEventID": "7380e72c0e029f55cff42cf4d437ea98c1d5bd9d206345e564d4c4511163b621",
  },
}
```

In the above example, name and title are not required to be unique within the concept graph. However, wordData.slug must be unique. To enfore uniqueness, the convention will be to create the slug from the name, using camel case, with underscore followed by the last 6 characters of whatever non-human-readable mutableidentifier is being used.

### wordTypes

`Words` (defined above) will be divided into `word types`. Any word can be (and usually will be) of more than one word type. Word types will be indicated as in the example below. For each word type `foo`, there will be a top-level object property called `fooData`.

```json
{
  "wordData": {
    "slug": "myWidget_63b621",
    "wordTypes": ["word", "widget"],
  },
  "widgetData": {
    "name": "my widget",
    "title": "My Widget",
  },
  ...
  "metaData": {
    "nostrEventID": "7380e72c0e029f55cff42cf4d437ea98c1d5bd9d206345e564d4c4511163b621",
  },
}
```

For each word type, properties `name`, `title`, and `description` will be made available by default but will not be required. Note that in the above example, name and title are present under widgetData and have been removed from wordData.

Note that the inclusion of 'word' as an item in wordData.wordTypes is implied and may be excluded without generating an error.

An example of a word with multiple word types:

```json
{
  "wordData": {
    "slug": "myWidget_63b621",
    "wordTypes": ["word", "animal", "dog"],
  },
  "animalData": {
    "animalType": "dog",
  },
  "dogData": {
    "name": "Fido",
  },
  ...
  "metaData": {
    "nostrEventID": "7380e72c0e029f55cff42cf4d437ea98c1d5bd9d206345e564d4c4511163b621",
  },
}
```

Note that in the above example, the set `dogs` is a subset of `animals`.
