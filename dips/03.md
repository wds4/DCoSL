Representation of a graph using simple lists.
------------------------------

## General principle

A graph consists of nodes and edges. An entire graph can be crowdsourced through the curation of no more than two simple lists: one for nodes, another for edges.

The allowed categories of edges (relationship types) will be determined by the developer. Optionally, the list of allowed relationship types could be turned into a third simple list and then crowdsourced.
