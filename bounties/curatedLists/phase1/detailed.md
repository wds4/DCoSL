STATUS OF THIS DOCUMENT: under construction




I'd be happy to designate a prearranged mutual acquaintance within the nostr community as arbiter to determine when bounty requirements have been met.

## Bonuese

### Bonues 1: repo; + 2 mil sats

(see above)

### Bonus 2: additional detail for nostr nerds; + 2 mil sats

Only if you can figure out how to do this without detracting from the overall UX. Make it so that users who are devs can explore the events and words. See pic of how I do this in Pretty Good Apps.

## More info

Please DM me npub1u5njm6g5h5cpw4wy8xugu62e5s7f6fnysv0sj0z3a8rengt2zqhsxrldq3 with questions, ideas, or words of encouragement! :-)
