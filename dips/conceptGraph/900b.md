DIP-900b
======

wordTypes
------------------------------

## General principle

`Words` (defined in previous DIP, DIP-900) will be organized into categories called `word types`. Most words will belong to multiple word types.

Conventions:
- Given a word with wordType: `foo`, there must be a top-level property `fooData`
- Word types will be indicated in the array `wordData.wordTypes` as in the example below. (`word` may be omitted from the `wordData.wordTypes` array, since it is assumed.)

## Example word types with their top level properties

| word type | top level property |
| ----- | ----- |
| foo | fooData |
| word | wordData |
| wordType | wordTypeData |
| list | listData |
| animal | animalData |
| rating | ratingData |
| ratingTemplate | ratingTemplateData |

## Examples

Example of a word of wordType:` widget`
```json
{
  "wordData": {
    "slug": "myWidget_e12345",
    "wordTypes": ["word", "widget"],
  },
  "widgetData": {
    "slug": "myWidget",
    "name": "my widget",
    "title": "My Widget",
    "description": "lorem ipsum",
  },
  ...
  "metaData": {
    "IPNS": "abcde12345",
  },
}
```

Example of a word with multiple wordTypes:

```json
{
  "wordData": {
    "wordTypes": ["word", "animal", "dog"],
  },
  "animalData": {
    "animalType": "dog",
  },
  "dogData": {
    "name": "Fido",
  },
  ...
  "metaData": {
    "IPNS": "abcde12345",
  },
}
```

Note that in the above example, the set `dogs` is a subset of `animals`.

## Creation of a new wordType

Implicit declaration:
- the creation of a word with top-level property `fooData` implies the word type `foo`.
- the declaration of a `list` (see upcoming DIP)
- the declaration of a `concept` (see upcoing DIP)

Explicit declaration:
One of the most important word types is, if you can believe it: `wordType`. It can be used to declare other word types, as in the example below:

Declaration of the word type: `animal`:

```json
{
  "wordData": {
    "wordTypes": ["word", "wordType"],
  },
  "wordTypeData": {
    "slug": "animal",
  },
  ...
  "metaData": {
    "IPNS": "abcde12345",
  },
}
```

Declaration of the word type: `wordType`:

```json
{
  "wordData": {
    "slug": "myWidget_e12345",
    "wordTypes": ["word", "wordType"],
  },
  "wordTypeData": {
    "slug": "wordType",
  },
  ...
  "metaData": {
    "IPNS": "abcde12345",
  },
}
```

## Default properties for newly declared word types

For each word type, by convention, properties `slug`, `name`, `title`, and `description` will be made available by default but will not necessarily be required. Note that in the first example above, `name` and `title` are present under `widgetData` but are absent from `wordData`.

Upcoming DIPs will provide tools to alter properties from the given defaults.
