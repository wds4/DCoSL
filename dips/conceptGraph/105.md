DIP-105

Publication of a word over nostr
------------------------------

This DIP proposes conventions for packaging a `word` (as defined by DIP-104) as a nostr event for publication over nostr.

List and list items are published as a note with kind anywhere in the range 9000 to 9999.
- kind 9901, with tag: `["c", "concept-graph-testnet-901"]`
- kind 9902, with tag: `["c", "concept-graph-testnet-902"]`
- mainnet is anticipated to launch using kind 9001, tag: `["c", "concept-graph-001"]`

The word is converted from JSON to a string and placed into the content field.

required tags:
- `["c", "concept-graph"]` 
- `["t", "createInstance"]` t indicates the task; here, we are creating a new instance for a concept

at least one, preferably both, of the following tags must be published to identify the parent list, of which this is an item:
- `["s", "foo"]` s stands for slug; foo is the name of the slug of the parent concept
- `["e", "ae641d5606f3ec710b135678810d4256fd2e92022896ca58d194c361c46d81f9"]` e is the event ID where the parent is published

Example: packaging the word `first test widget entry` as an item on the list of `widgets`:

```json
{
    "kind": 9901,
    "tags": [
        ["c", "concept-graph-testnet-901"],
        ["t", "createInstance"],
        ["e", "ae641d5606f3ec710b135678810d4256fd2e92022896ca58d194c361c46d81f9"],
        ["s", "widget"]
    ],
    "content": "{\"widgetData\":{\"name\":\"first test widget entry\",\"slug\":\"firstTestWidgetEntry\",\"description\":\"a sample entry to the list of widgets\"}}",
    ...other fields
}
```
