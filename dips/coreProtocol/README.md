# DIPs 00-99: Core Principles

DCoSL is the first step towards implementation of the threaded tapestry model of knowledge representation and knowledge curation for decentralized, distributed systems. This set of DIPs establishes the core principles of this model.

Note: numbering of DIPs is subject to change.

- [DIP-0](0.md) Data is represented as graphs: collections of nodes and edges

- [DIP-00](00.md) Data curation: the principle of relativity

- [DIP-01](01.md) Rely on explicit attestations rather than scraped data.

- [DIP-02](02.md) Use cryptographic identifiers for lists and list items.

- [DIP-03](03.md) Representation of a graph using simple lists.

- [DIP-infinity](infinity.md) All DIPs are crowdsourced using the DCoSL method.

## Under construction

Maybe categorize "core protocol" DIPs as more general principles, less protocol per se:
- unique identifiers (move from 100b?)
- perhaps the basic idea of a "word" should be moved here? (currently DIP-100)
