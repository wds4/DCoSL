# DIPs 00-99: Core Principles

DCoSL is the first step towards implementation of the threaded tapestry model of knowledge representation and knowledge curation for decentralized, distributed systems. This set of DIPs establishes the core principles of this model.

Note: numbering of DIPs is subject to change.

- [DIP-00](00.md) Everything is a graph

Data is represented as graphs: collections of nodes and edges

- [DIP-01](01.md) Everything is in the eye of the beholder

Data curation using the principle of relativity. There is no one list to rule them all.

- [DIP-02](02.md) Rely on explicit attestations rather than scraped data.

- [DIP-03](03.md) how to avoid domain squatting

- [DIP-04](04.md) accomplish curation of a graph into curation of a few simple lists.

- [DIP-infinity](infinity.md) All DIPs are crowdsourced using the DCoSL method.

## Under construction

Maybe categorize "core protocol" DIPs as more general principles, less protocol per se:
- networks and universally unique identifiers (move from 100b?)
- perhaps the basic idea of a "word" should be moved here? (currently DIP-100)

Grapevine-related core principles:
- trust is contextual 
- trust isn't trust, it's numeric
- confidence needs to be tracked 
- contexts are arranged in trees 
- default trust levels are user-adjustable
- trust is inherited down the context tree
