class
======

As defined [here](https://brilliant.org/wiki/classes-oop/), `classes` in object oriented programming are templates or blueprints for creating `objects` (a particular data structure), providing initial values for state (member variables or attributes), and implementations of behavior (member functions or methods).

Each OOP language has its own conception of a `class` (usually going by the name `class`, although sometimes going by a different name). Although classes in different languages are similar, they are not exactly the same. 

In DCoSL, the notion of a `concept` can be thought of as an abstration of the notion in OOP of a class. (See definitions of class thread, class node, class instance; concept = class node + all class threads emanating from it, and all the nodes and edges traversed by such threads; where to summarize this?)
