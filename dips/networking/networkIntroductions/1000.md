integration of DCoSL with nostr

# background / overview

[Nostr](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nostr) is the first and so far the only network to be integrated with DCoSL. 

# network description 

# rationale for integration

Previous attempts to integrate the concept graph with the IPFS were met with slow progress. 

# unique identifiers

## data chunks 

Data chunks are referred to in nostr as "nodes." The most frequently utilized nodes are objects referred to as "words."

## methods to label data

Words and other nodes may be identified with:

Locally unique identifiers:
- slug
  
Universally unique identifiers:
- event id
- pubkey of the publisher (called "data steward") + slug (required) +/- version (optional)
