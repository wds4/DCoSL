DIP-104
======

relationshipTypes
------------------------------

Following the convention of [DIP-102](102.md), a new `wordType` will be introduced: `relationshipType`.

## Background

[Relationships](../../glossary/relationship.md) were introduced in [DIP-103](103.md). Just as words were organized in DIP-??? into categories called word types, in this DIP, relationships will be organized into categories called relationship types. Unlike words, which are generally belong to multiple word types, any given relationship generally makes use of only a single relationship type.

## Declaration

See [here](declarations/relationshipType.md).

## Example:

```json
{
  "wordData": {
    "wordTypes": ["relationshipType"],
  },
  "relationshipTypeData": {
  },
  ...
}
```
