class thread rule
=====
The requirement that every [class instance](classInstance.md) must follow the blueprint instructions specified in or transmitted by the [class node](classNode.md) is called the `class thread rule`.

Following the recommendations of [concept graph DIPs](../dips/conceptGraph), the class node is typically a [JSON schema](jsonSchema.md), and the class instance is a [word](word.md) that is subject to the JSON schema's formatting specifications. However, the expectation is that alternatives to JSON schema, and even alternatvies to JSON, will also be implemented within the DCoSL protocol.
