DIP-299
=====

This DIP describes use of [NIP-32](https://github.com/staab/nips/blob/nip-32-labeling/32.md) to broadcast a rating.


```json
{
  "kind": 1985,
  "tags": [
    ["L", "com.dcosl.ontology"],
    ["l", <ratingTemplate>, "com.dcosl.ontology",<json rating data>],
    <ratee>,
  ],
  "content": "",
  ...
}
```

`ratingTemplate` examples: `rating/`

Per NIP-32 recommendations, `<JSON rating data>` would be a serialized version of an object with the following suggested keys:

```json
{
  "quality": <a number between 0 and 1>,
  "confidence": <a number between 0 and 1>,
  "context": <any string>
}
```

### Example

```json
{
  "kind": 1985,
  "tags": [
    ["L", "com.dcosl.ontology"],
    ["l", "review", "com.dcosl.ontology",""],
    ["p", <pubkey1>, <relay_url>],
  ],
  "content": "",
  ...
}
```
