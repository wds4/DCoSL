DIP-103

Concept Graph
------------------------------

## General principle

According to this DIP, users are given the ability to manage individually as well as to crowdsource concept graphs.

A concept graph is a [graph](../../glossary/graph.md) of [concepts](../../glossary/concept.md) that is focused on the three primary [relationship types](../../glossary/relationshipType.md) which relate one concept to another:

`isASubsetOf`

`isASpecificInstanceOf`

`isAPropertyOf`
