DIP-903
=====
steward self-identification
-----

# Background

A "steward of the concept graph", "steward og DCoSL", "steward of the threaded tapestry" or simply "steward" is a type of nostr profile which publishes words to the nostr network using [DIP-901](901.md). This DIP outlines methods for a nostr profile to broadcast its role as a steward, as well as what categories of steward.

# Method 1: broadcast an event

The steward can broadcast a note using the protocol of [DIP-901](901.md) using the task: `selfIdentifyAsSteward`

Other users can then obtain a list of all profiles that self-idetify as stewards of the concept graph using the following filter:

```json
{
  "since": 0,
  "kinds": [9902],
  "#t": ["selfIdentifyAsSteward"]
}
```

# Method 2: include information in the profile `about` section

work in progress

# Method 3: include "Steward" in the profile name

This is a suggestied convention only but is likely not to be used to find stewards formally.
