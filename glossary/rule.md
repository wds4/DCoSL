rule
=====

A single [pattern](pattern.md) coupled with a single [action](action.md), in which the pattern is understood to trigger the action wherever it is discovered, is called a rule. It may be transcribed as a set with two elements: [pattern_x, action_y]. A [ruleset](ruleset.md) is a set of rules. Frequently, a ruleset is grouped so that all elements in the ruleset are the same pattern.
