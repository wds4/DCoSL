DIP-103
======

relationship
------------------------------

Following the convention of [DIP-900](900.md), a new `wordType` will be introduced: `relationship`.

## Background: 

In DCoSL, data will frequently be represented as a [graph](../../glossary/graph.md), with [nodes](../../glossary/node.md) and [edges](../../glossary/relationship.md). DIP-900 (?) provides conventions for nodes that are JSON data objects. In this DIP, we provide conventions for edges, a.k.a. `relationships`.

An edge is represented as a `relationship` between two nodes. It may or may not be oriented. Each relationship is given a relationship type (see DIP-???).

## Declaration

Following the convention of [DIP-900](900.md), a new `wordType` will be declared: `relationship`

```json
{
  "wordData": {
    "wordTypes": ["wordType"],
  },
  "wordTypeData": {
    "slug": "relationship"
  },
  ...
}
```

## Example:

```json
{
  "wordData": {
    "wordTypes": ["relationship"],
  },
  "relationshipData": {
  },
  ...
}
```

## Properties 

Fields within `relationshipData` will be required to indicate the identity of the two nodes that are connected by the relationship as well as the relationship type. Relationship types are declared in DIP-???. Methods to specify fields will be specified in upcoming DIPs. The exact properties may vary from application to application, but the example below provides one illustration:

```json
{
  "wordData": {
    "wordTypes": ["relationship"],
  },
  "relationshipData": {
    "nodeFrom": {
      "slug": "alice"
    },
    "relationshipType": {
      "slug": "isMarriedTo"
    }
    "nodeTo": {
      "slug": "bob"
    }
  },
  ...
}
```
