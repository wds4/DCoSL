threaded tapestry
=====

The `threaded tapestry` model is a proposed model of [knowledge representation](knowledgeRepresentation.md) and [knowledge curation](knowledgeCuration.md) for a [decentralized, distributed system](decentralizedDistributedSystem.md) such as the decentralized web. It is designed to solve one of the chief problems faced by such networks: how to develop and manage a common language, without which no network can properly function, without the need to place any single entity in charge of the network.

In the threaded tapestry model, information is broken into chunks which are represented as nodes in a graph. A specialized path called a [class thread](classThread.md) is employed as a central tool for organization of information into [concepts](concept.md), comparable in some ways to the way that a [class](class.md) is used to organize objects in many object oriented programming languages.
