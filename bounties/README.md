Bounties
=====

The following are a series of bounties to demonstrate the DCoSL protocol, culminating in the Nostr Channels app which will allow the decentralized curation of nostr feeds based on topic. 

When ready, they will be submitted to [nostr bounties](https://nostrbounties.com).

# [Curated Lists](./curatedLists) (web app)

Refactor Curated Lists, which is already built and currently functional as an app in the Pretty Good Apps desktop client, as a website with a stellar UX.

Milestone: 

# [Curated Graphs](./curatedGraphs) (web app)

Once Curated Lists bounties are complete, bounties will be offered to refactor Curated Graphs as a web app.

A prototype for Curated Graphs is under construction in Pretty Good Apps, currently under the name: Curated Channels. The basic idea is that a graph is composed of two lists: one list for nodes, one for edges. The basic tools for list curation can therefore be leveraged for curation of graphs.

# [Channels: Curated Feeds](./curatedFeeds) (feature added to existing nostr clients)

This bounty will culminate in the incorporation of the tools created in previous bounties by one or more existing nost clients and will allow users to curate their nostr feeds by topic. One or more phases will be to add this functionality to existing clients. Before that can happen, one or more initial phases may be required for the creation of libraries that can be used by clients wishing to incorporate this feature.

The tools created for Curated Graphs will allow users to crowdsource a Topics Tree according to which, for example, smartphones and electronics are two topics, with smartphones being a subcategory of electronics. For each topic, users will also crowdsource an associated list of pubkeys that generate content that matches that topic. Alternatively, instead of crowdsourcing a list of pubkeys for each topic, crowdsource a list of notes for each topic.
