decentralized, distributed system
=====

For the sake of this essay, a distributed system is defined as a set of entities which will from time to time assemble into networks (a subset of the system's entities; e.g; a social media network) that engage in peer-to-peer communication, requiring network-wide (not necessarily system-wide) consensus on rules and symbols of communication, i.e. a language. The system is said to be decentralized if there is no entity with a presumed, guaranteed or prespecified authority to define, maintain, update, assert any such language over the entire network.
