## DIPs 200-299: the Grapevine

# UNDER CONSTRUCTION

weighted averages; contextual influence; each attestation is accompanied by confidence; each calculated score is accompanied by input, which is sum of weights

core relationships: attestations, ratings, endorsements

Entire libraries, platforms, protocols are subjected to decentralized curation via DCoSL. Repository management by dev teams, standards managed by committees, etc will diminish, because the option of management via WoT will exist.

Several of the proposed DIPs consist of lists: the list of node types, the list of relationships types, etc. In this series of DIPs, those lists are themselves curated according to the principles of DIP-0 and potentially other DIPs. 

- [DIP-200](200.md) 

- [DIP-201](201.md): 

The grapevine: scores as weighted averages

The grapevine: transitivity

The grapevine: default scores

The grapevine: context trees and score inheritance of average scores

The grapevine: confidence and certainty
