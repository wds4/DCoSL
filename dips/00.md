# DIP-1: Explicit Attestations vs data scraping

According to this dip, list curation is based upon explicit attestations (EA) rather than scraped data (SD) obtained using other methods. These are two opposing methods, described and discussed (here). DIP-1 is based on the attitude that curation via EA is more trustworthy than SD, and that the superiority of EA will grow as the DCoSL ecosystem grows and matures. Of course, a combination of these two methods may be utilized. This dip details a method to use EA by itself.
