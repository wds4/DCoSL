Concept
------------------------------

## General principle

A concept is defined as a collection of nodes and edges, formed from a single class node, taking all class threads emanating from that node (all nodes and edges contained within those threads). (Is property tree added to the definition of the concept?)

# NOTES

basic types of nodes in a concept: JSONSchema, wordType, set, superset, instance

basic types of relationships: subsetOf, JSONSchemaFor, specificInstanceOf

the Loki Principle = class thread rule
