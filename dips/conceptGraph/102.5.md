# unique identifiers

This DIP discusses the several types of unique identifiers that may be used in specification of a word.

There will be two categories of unique identifiers:
- globally unique identifiers (typically a cruptographic hash; non human readable)
- locally unique identifiers (usually human readable)


## Locally unique identifiers

Locally unique means that within a specified graph, there is no other word with the same identifier. Usually, locally unique identifiers will be human readable. 

One of the criteria of a [concept graph](../glossary/conceptGraph.md) is that `wordData.slug` serves as a locally unique identifier (local to the concept graph). 

In some cases, a [concept](../glossary/concept.md) may have some additional identifier (in addition to `wordData.slug`) that is locally unique within the concept, e.g. `playerData.jerseyNumber`.

The requirement of local uniqueness is specified by setting the `unique` field in the appropriate [property](../glossary/property.md) to `true`.

## Universally unique identifiers

Typically a cryptograph hash. Prominent examples include:
- a nostr event id used to publish the word, as per [DIP-101](101.md)
- IPFS hash
- IPNS name

### mutable vs immutable unique identifiers

Mutable identifiers, like the IPNS name, can be placed inside the word itself. Typically this will go into `metaData`. Immutable identifiers like the IPFS hash or the nostr id cannot be placed into the word itself, for obvious reasons.
