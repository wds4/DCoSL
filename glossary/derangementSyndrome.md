Derangement Syndrome
=====

`Derangement syndrome` is defined as being possessed of the strongly held notion that pretense (encouraging the censorship of objective reality in others by way of self-censorship) is a virtue when those facts may be interpreted ("taken out of context") as favoring the narrative of an opposing tribe ("literal fascists").

Although the term was first applied in the cotext of Trump Derangement Syndrome, TDS is simply a specific case of the more generalized phenomenon. It may be hypothesied that Trump explicitly, perhaps even consciously, induced TDS among a large part of the population so as to draw support from those not so triggered (those who are not predisposed to the TDS variation of DS).
